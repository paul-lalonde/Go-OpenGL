A fork of the OpenGL bindinds by banthar (github.com/banthar/Go-OpenGL)
Moves the bindings to Go 1 structure, "go get"able.

You will need GLEW(http://glew.sourceforge.net/) at least version 1.5.8.

All GL headers are expected to be in /usr/include/GL/

To compile examples you will also need sdl bindings from: http://github.com/banthar/Go-SDL

To install type:
	gomake
